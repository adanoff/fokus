# Fokus ✏️

Fokus helps you (wait for it) focus on short pieces of information in a
distraction-free way.

It consists of only an HTML file, a Javascript file, and a CSS file. Simply
clone the repo, navigate to the file in your browser, and you're up and running!
Alternatively, set it as your browser homepage for a focus-filled experience
whenver you explore the InterwebZ!

## Motivation

Jokes aside, I am often struck by the urge to think deeply on a specific issue.
Sometimes that issue is a big one, other times it's a small one. I find that
thinking deeply about smaller more manageable issues is much more fruitful than
trying to tackle a big issue all at once, and so I created Fokus. Now I can
easily contemplate bite-sized issues distraction free.

I hacked this project together in around 2 hours (no less than 30 minutes of
which consisted of centering things in CSS). My technical goals were to refresh
myself on good ol' vanilla CSS3 and jQuery, no frameworks needed. The project
was completed between 11 PM and 1 AM, so don't be too hard on me :)

## TODO

- [ ] Add color picker, theming, etc
